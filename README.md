# Leetcode

This repo contains my solutions to some of the questions on the website https://leetcode.com/. The link to my id is https://leetcode.com/sonali9696/. Please note that they do not contain main function and hence can't be directly run on any other IDE except on Leetcode.

Note: Some of these solutions contain multiple approaches. I have commented out the other approaches and uncommented the most optimal one

Please take a look at the solutions only after giving an honest try to the Leetcode questions. I hope these solutions are able to help you :)
